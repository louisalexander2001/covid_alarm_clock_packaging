Welcome to Covid Smart Alarm Clock's documentation!
===================================================
This project is designed to help make it easier for users to schedule when they get updates on key information during the COVID-19 pandemic. The package allows users to get the latest COVID stats, the weather and the headlines all in the same place. They can choose when they get an announcement, and whether or not news and weather updates accompany the latest stats. This can all be done from the users browser.
