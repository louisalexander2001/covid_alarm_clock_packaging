Description: # COVID Smart Alarm Clock
        
        This project is designed to help make it easier for users to schedule when they get updates on key information during the COVID-19 pandemic. The package allows users to get the latest COVID stats, the weather and the headlines all in the same place. They can choose when they get an announcement, and whether or not news and weather updates accompany the latest stats. This can all be done from the users browser.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        This package relies on a number of other modules. The modules that must be installed are `pyttsx3`, `flask` and `uk_covid19`. This can be done with the following commands
